# Machine learning - Simple Linear Regression model
Repo demonstrating simple machine learning on linear regression model using matrix factorization. Model training, verification and predication is all covered in this repo codebase.

## How to run
1. Goto terminal and navigate to source root, where this readme file is present.
2. Create virtual environment at root folder by following command.
`virtualenv -p python3 venv`
3. Activate virtual environment.
`source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install project dependencies.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run machine learning analysis.
`python src/train.py`
6. Run api server to get prediction.
`python src/app.py`
7. To deactivate the virtual environment.
`deactivate`
